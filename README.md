# BRM-BakeUI
Texture baking UI for Blender

![UI screenshot](http://www.brameulaers.net/blender/addons/github_images/brm_bakeUI.gif)

Very WIP, will add detailed instructions in the near future.
For now:


-install add-on

-you can find the UI under the "bake" tab in the tools panel

-in lowpoly enter your lowpoly object's name

-in hipoly enter the name of you hipoly object or group

-it uses cycles for baking, so make sure your hipoly meshes have cycles materials assigned to them

-select the maps you want to bake out, and bake them to your desired folder!

-baked textures will automatically update in Blender, so assign them to your lowpoly mesh's material for a quick iterative workflow.
