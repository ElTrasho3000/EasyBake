Very WIP, will add detailed instructions in the near future.
For now:


-install add-on

-you can find the UI under the "bake" tab in the tools panel

-in lowpoly enter your lowpoly object's name

-in hipoly enter the name of you hipoly object or group

-select the maps you want to bake out, and bake them to your desired folder!
